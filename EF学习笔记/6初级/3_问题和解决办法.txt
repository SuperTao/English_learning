个人问题
 
如果你无法停止做某事，你就是对它addicted，或你对它有了一种addiction，下面就是一些常见的沉溺。

谈论问题
 
在确定一个问题后，你可能想详细加以解释。以下是一些帮助你进行解释的表达。

She can't quit smoking. One big problem is that her husband smokes, too.	 	她戒不了烟。一个大问题是她的丈夫也抽烟。

that可省略而不会造成意义的改变。

情态动词 'ought to'和'had better'
 
你可以使用情态动词 ought to 和 had better 来给予个人建议。Had better 语气强于ought to，在提出强烈的建议时使用。
 

He's very overweight. He ought to lose some weight.	他很胖，应该减减肥。
 	 	 

Your health is very poor. You had better quit smoking.	你身体很不好，最好把烟戒了。
 	 	 

had better 的否定是 had better not。ought to 的否定是 ought not to，但很少使用。
 


You had better not start smoking. It's a terrible habit.	你最好不要开始吸烟。这个习惯很不好。
 	 	 

She has terrible insomnia. She ought not to drink coffee in the evening.	她严重失眠。她晚上不应该喝咖啡。

提出强烈建议有许多方法。学习这些不同的表达。

'who' 引导的关系从句
 
用关系从句连接两个句子。关系从句使您的写作和讲话更流利，并帮助您避免重复。关系代词 who 用来指人。
 

We have a lot of engineers. The engineers work late.                  

We have a lot of engineers who work late.

在例子中，主句We have a lot of engineers 是一个完整的句子。关系从句who work late不是一个完整的句子，故不能独立成句。

公司问题
 
您的个人或专业生活中可能会出现问题。公司也可能遇到问题。研究下面的常见公司问题。
 

Business is bad, and employee morale is low.	生意很差，而且员工士气低落。

Communication between management and staff is poor.	管理层和员工之间的沟通不畅。

There is a continuing problem of employee theft in the company.	公司里有员工盗窃的问题。

The company's costs are going up and up.	公司的开支一直在上涨。

Competition is fierce in our industry.	我们行业的竞争很激烈。

Because of terrible mismanagement, the company is in trouble.	因为管理不善，公司现在陷入困境。

The company's biggest problem is a lack of innovation.	公司最大的问题是缺乏创新。

We don't have the money to buy the latest technology.	我们没有购买最新技术的资金。

'that' 引导的关系从句
 
用关系代词连接两个句子。用关系代词that 代替事物。
 

I work for a company. The company has lots of problems.

I work for a company that has lots of problems.

在该例子中，主句I work for a company 是一个完整句，关系从句that has lots of problems 不是完整句，故不能单独成句。

记住，使用关系从句可以让你的作文和讲话更流畅，避免重复。

提出解决办法
 
使用类似表达来提出解决办法:
 

One solution could be that we hire a new manager.	一种解决办法是我们雇一位新经理。

Another possibility would be to have a team meeting.	另一种可能是开一场团队会议。
 	 
为了竭力提出解决方法，使用类似下列表达。
 

I really think that the only solution is to replace the entire management team.	我真的认为唯一的解决办法是替换整个管理团队。

The only way to solve this problem is to buy the company.	解决问题的唯一办法是买下这家公司。
